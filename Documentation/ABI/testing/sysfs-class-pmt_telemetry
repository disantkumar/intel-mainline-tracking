Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The telem<x> directory contains files describing an instance of
		a PMT telemetry device that exposes hardware telemetry. Each
		telem<x> directory has an associated /dev/telem<x> node. This
		node may be opened and mapped to access the telemetry space of
		the device. The register layout of the telemetry space is
		determined from an XML file that matches the PCI device id and
		GUID for the device.
