	bool "Temperature sensor driver for Intel tsens"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	select THERMAL
	help
	  This option enables tsens thermal local Host driver.

	  This driver is used for reporting thermal data via thermal
	  framework.
	  Enable this option if you want to have support for thermal
	  management controller.
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as
	  Keem Bay.  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  This option enables tsens I2C slave driver.

	  This driver is used for reporting thermal data via I2C
	  SMBUS to remote host.
	  Enable this option if you want to have support for thermal
	  management controller.
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as

	depends on I2C_SMBUS
	help
	  This option enables tsens i2c and thermal local Host driver.

	  This driver is used for reading thermal data via I2C SMBUS
	  and registers itself to thermal framework, which can be
	  used by thermal daemon in remote IA host
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as
	  Keem Bay.  If unsure, say N.
